Math is wonderfully complex, and many have offered their own interpretations of what it means.

You don\u2019t necessarily need a detailed map to give you information about where you are. Instead, you\u2019re more interested in how points of interest in the city connect to each other. You only want to know if there is a path between landmarks and nothing else. We don\u2019t care about the shape of the roads, just whether there is a road that takes us from one building to the next.

Instead of drawings of buildings, let\u2019s just have a circle with the name of the building. Instead of having a detailed reconstruction of the roads of our city, let\u2019s just have a line connect two circles if there is a road connecting two buildings. Now our map looks quite different! To the untrained eye, it looks like a bunch of randomly connected circles. But we devised this new model with a specific goal in mind - to understand how buildings in our city are connected at a high level. We want to look at our map and instantly know if there is a way to get from one building to the next. The details of the route are not important anymore, we just want to know if it\u2019s possible.

If we were to give our new map to a new resident of the city, they would probably look at us with confusion and ask us to leave them alone. But why are they behaving like this? It\u2019s because our new map lacks the necessary details for navigation and only really makes sense to someone who has already lived in the city. To a newcomer who still ",o.a.createElement("i",null,"needs")," the details, it doesn\u2019t do a great job.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"This paves the way for another key insight: abstraction is a spectrum.

For example, we could spend our whole life studying the color blue, but that really doesn\u2019t help us understand color as a whole. We should instead look at the ",o.a.createElement("i",null,"set")," of all colors, of which blue is an ",o.a.createElement("i",null,"element"),". Now, anything we glean about this set applies not only to blue, but to ",o.a.createElement("i",null,"all")," colors, and our life has no longer been wasted!
